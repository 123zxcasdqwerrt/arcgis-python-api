    "Land cover classification has been one of the most common tasks in remote sensing as it is the foundation for many global and environmental applications. Traditionally, people have been using algorithms like maximum likelihood classifier, SVM, random forest, and object-based classification. The recent success of AI brings new opportunity to this field. This notebook showcases an end-to-end to land cover classification workflow using ArcGIS API for Python. The workflow consists of three major steps: (1) extract training data, (2) train a deep learning image segmentation model, (3) deploy the model for inference and create maps. To better illustrate this process, we will use NAIP imagery and high-resolution labeled data provided by the [Chesapeake Conservancy land cover project](https://chesapeakeconservancy.org/conservation-innovation-center/high-resolution-data/land-cover-data-project/).\n",

It has an encoding path (“contracting”) paired with a decoding path (“expanding”) which gives it the “U” shape. However, in contrast to the autoencoder, U-Net predicts a pixelwise segmentation map of the input image rather than classifying the input image as a whole. For each pixel in the original image, it asks the question: “To which class does this pixel belong?”. U-Net passes the feature maps from each level of the contracting path over to the analogous level in the expanding path.  These are similar to residual connections in a ResNet type model, and allow the classifier to consider features at various scales and complexities to make its decision."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In thise notebook, we have covered a lot of ground. In part 1, we discussed how to export training data for deep learning using ArcGIS python API and what the output looks like. In part 2, we demonstrated how to prepare the input data, train a object detection model, visualize the results, as well as apply the model to an unseen image using the deep learning module in ArcGIS API for Python. Then we covered how to install and publish this model and make it production-ready in part 3.\n",
