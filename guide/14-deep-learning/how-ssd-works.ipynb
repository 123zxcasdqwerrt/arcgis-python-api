Sounds simple! Well, there are at least two problems: \n",

    "In practice, there are two types of mainstream object detection algorithms. Algorithms like R-CNN and Fast(er) R-CNN use a two stage approach - first to identify regions where objects are expected to be found and then detect objects only in those regions using convnet. The other type of object detection networks such as YOLO (You Only Look Once) [1] and SSD (Single-Shot Detector) [2] use a fully convolutional approach in which the network is able to find all objects within an image in one pass (hence ‘single-shot’ or ‘look once’) through the convnet. The region proposal algorithms usually have slightly better accuracy but slower to run, while algorithms like SSD is more efficient and has reasonable accuracy and that's what we are going to focus on in this section."

    "SSD has two components: a __backbone__ model and __SSD head__. _Backbone_ model usually is a pre-trained image classification network as a feature extractor. This is typically a network like ResNet trained on ImageNet from which the final fully connected layer to come up with the predicted class of an input image has been removed. We are thus left with a deep neural network that is able to extract semantic meaning from the input image while preserving the spatial structure of the image albeit at a lower resolution. For ResNet34, the backbone results in a 256 7x7 channels for each input image. The _SSD head_ is just one or more convolutional layers are added to this backbone and the outputs are interpreted as the bounding boxes and classes of objects in the spatial location of the final layers activations. \n",

    "\n",
    "Instead of using sliding window, SSD divides the image using a grid and have each grid cell be responsible for detecting objects in that region of the image. Detection objects simply means predicting the class and location of an object within that region. If no object is present, we consider it as the background class and the location is ignored. For instance, we could use a 4x4 grid in the example below. Each grid cell is able to output the position and shape of the object it contains.\n",

    "### Anchor box\n",
    "\n",
    "Each grid cell in SSD can be assigned with multiple anchor/prior boxes. These anchor boxes are pre-defined and each one is responsible for a size and shape within a grid cell. For example, the person in the image below corresponds to the taller anchor box while the car corresponds to the wider box.\n",

    "SSD uses a matching phase while training, to match the appropriate anchor box with the bounding boxes of each ground truth object within an image. Essentially, the anchor box with the highest degree of overlap with an object is responsible for predicting that object’s class and its location. This property is used for training the network and for predicting the detected objects and their locations once the network has been trained. In practice, each anchor box is specified by an aspect ratio and a zoom level.\n",

    "### Receptive Field\n",
    "\n",
    "Receptive field is defined as __the region in the input space that a particular CNN’s feature (i.e. a pixel in the convolutional layers) is looking at (i.e. be affected by)__. Because of the the convolution operation, features at different layers represent different sizes of region in the input image. As it goes deeper, the size represented by a feature gets larger. In this example below, we start with the bottom layer (5x5) and then apply a convolution that results in the middle layer (3x3) where one feature (green pixel) represents a 3x3 region of the input layer (bottom layer). And then apply the convolution to middle layer and get the top layer (2x2) where each feature corresponds to a 7x7 region on the input image. These kind green and orange 2D matrix are also called __feature maps__ which refer to a set of features created by applying the same feature extractor at different locations of the input map in a sliding window fastion. Features in the same feature map have the same receptive field and look for the same pattern but at different locations. This creates the spatial invariance of ConvNet.\n",
    "<img src=\"img/receptive1.png\" height=\"500\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Receptive field is the central premise of the SSD architecture as it enables us to detect objects at different scales and output a tighter bounding box. Why? As you might still remember, the ResNet34 backbone outputs a 256 7x7 feature maps for an input image. If we specify a 4x4 grid, the simpliest approach is just to apply a convolution to this feature map and convert it to 4x4. This approach can actually work to some extent and is exatcly the idea of YOLO (You Only Look Once). The extra step taken by SSD is that it applies more convolutional layers to the backbone feature map and has each of these convolution layers output a object detection results. __As earlier layers bearing smaller receptive field can represent smaller sized objects, predictions from earlier layers help in dealing with smaller sized objects__.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, SSD allows us to define several layers or hierarchies of grid cells. For example, we could use a 4x4 grid to find smaller objects, a 2x2 grid to find mid sized objects and a 1x1 grid to find objects that cover the entire image."

    "The grids parameter specifies the size of the grid cell, in this case 4x4. Additionally, we are specifying a zoom level of 1.0 and aspect ratio of 1.0:1.0. What this essentially means is that the network will create an anchor box for each grid cell, which is the same size as the grid cell (zoom level of 1.0) and is square in shape with an aspect ratio of 1.0:1.0. The output activations along the depth of the final feature map are used to shift and scale (within a reasonable limit) this anchor box so it can approach the actual bounding box of the object even if it doesn’t exactly match with the anchor box. \n",
