    "## Using the Workforce Python Module to Automate Workforce for ArcGIS\n",
    "\n",
    "Workforce for ArcGIS is a mobile solution that uses the power of location-based decision making for better field workforce coordination and teamwork. It is composed of a web app used by project administrators and dispatchers in the office, and a mobile app used by mobile workers on their devices. Organizations using Workforce for ArcGIS get these benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Everything you need on one device—Mobile workers can easily view and process work assignments, provide updates on work status, and inform others of their location, all from one device.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Greater agility—Using real-time and location-based information, dispatchers can assign and prioritize fieldwork on the fly and ensure that work is assigned to the right people at the right time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increased productivity—Replace time-consuming and error-prone manual workforce management processes, reduce downtime, and keep projects on schedule."

    "### Workforce Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The following was extracted/summarized from [here](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/workforce/android-phone/help/workforce-schema.htm).\n",
    "\n",
    "A workforce project is composed of four feature layers and four coded value domains with a predefined schema. The name of each feature layer is a combination of a moniker, describing the purpose of the feature layer, appended with the GUID of the Workforce project item. For example, the Workers layer associated with a project with GUID 5dd018fcd88c4d33814cf3da9c44061e would be named workers_5dd018fcd88c4d33814cf3da9c44061e. This guarantees uniqueness of each feature layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four feature layers are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Workers**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - A point feature layer that contains a record for each mobile worker who is included in the project.\n",
    "  - Includes information about the mobile worker, including their contact number and job title.\n",
    "  - The mobile worker's ArcGIS organizational user name is stored in the userId field.\n",
    "  - The layer tracks who created and last updated each mobile worker.\n",
    "  - There is a primary key-foreign key (PK-FK) relationship from OBJECTID to Assignments.workerId. Using the OBJECTID value from the Workers layer as the Assignments.workerId field value associates the mobile worker with all their assignments.\n",
    "  - The layer has the following coded value domain associations:\n",
    "  - The status field is associated with the Worker_Status coded value domain to track the mobile worker status.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assignments**\n",
    "\n",
    "  - A point feature layer that contains a record for each assignment.\n",
    "  - Includes information about the assignment, including its status, location, and description, among others.\n",
    "  - The layer tracks who created and last updated each assignment.\n",
    "  - Attachments are enabled on the feature layer.\n",
    "  - The layer contains foreign keys for some fields, associating values from another layer with this layer:\n",
    "    - Assignments.workerId to Workers.OBJECTID.\n",
    "    - Assignments.dispatcherId to Dispatchers.OBJECTID.\n",
    "    - Assignments.workOrderId can be used as a foreign key to an external system, such as an asset or maintenance management system, by providing values from the other system.\n",
    "  - The layer has the following coded value domain associations:\n",
    "    - The status field is associated with the Assign_Status coded value domain to track the assignment status.\n",
    "    - The priority field is associated with the Priority coded value domain to manage the priority of work assignments.\n",
    "    - The assignmentType field is associated with the Assign_Type coded value domain to store the assignment types for the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dispatchers**\n",
    "  - A point feature layer that contains a record for each dispatcher within the project.\n",
    "  - Includes information about the dispatcher, including their name and contact number.\n",
    "  - The dispatcher's ArcGIS organizational user name is stored in the userId field.\n",
    "  - The layer tracks who created and last updated each dispatcher.\n",
    "  - There is a PK-FK relationship from OBJECTID to Assignments.dispatcherId. Using the OBJECTID value from the Dispatchers layer as the Assignments.dispatcherId field value associates the dispatcher with all the assignments they assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Location Tracking**\n",
    "  - A point feature layer that contains a record for each point location logged while location tracking is enabled.\n",
    "  - The layer tracks who created and last updated each location track.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Additionally, a workforce project contains two webmaps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dispatcher Webmap**\n",
    "  - This map is what the dispatchers using the back-office web app see\n",
    "  - It shows the assignments and worker locations\n",
    "  - Additional layers can be added to this map\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Worker Webmap**\n",
    "  - This map is what a field worker uses on their iOS or Android device\n",
    "  - Additional layers can be added to this map\n",
    "  \n",
    "When a new project is created via the web application, a new **Group** is created. All of the layers, webmaps, and the project item itself are shared into this group.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a new project is created via the web application, a new **Folder** is created. All of the layers, webmaps, and the project item itself are shared into this folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there is the actual **Workforce Project** item. This is an item on the portal that stores project meta data in json format.\n",
    "\n",
