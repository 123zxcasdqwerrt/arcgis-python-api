    "## Conda Environments\n",
    "Now you have conda and the ArcGIS API for Python installed. Let's talk about the basics of conda so you can manage installations and set up IDEs for projects and scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to understand conda is by working through the [30-minute Getting Started](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/getting-started.html) tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conda manages packages and dependencies through [environments](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/concepts.html#conda-environments), which are physical directories on your disk system that isolate the specific Python interpreter and packages you install in them. You can easily create and switch between environments without affecting other environments. For detailed explanation and instructions, see the conda documentation on [Managing environments](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Default Environments:\n",
    "You can list the conda environments on your machine in a terminal application:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda env list`\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Add the directory with the conda executables to your PATH to run the conda command from anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ArcGIS Pro\n",
    "After the installation, you will have 2 conda environments on your system. \n",
    "* root\n",
    " \n",
    " This environment contains an installation of [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html), a smaller version of Anaconda that includes conda, Python, the packages they depend on, as well as a select set of useful packages. \n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "* arcgispro-py3\n",
    "\n",
    " This environment contains the arcgispro package, including all the [ArcPy](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/arcpy/get-started/what-is-arcpy-.htm) functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Manage conda environments with ArcGIS Pro:</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use 3 different methods to maintain your conda environments. Each provides methods to install, update and remove packages:\n",
    "* [Python Package Manager](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/arcpy/get-started/what-is-conda.htm)\n",
    " \n",
    " A GUI tool accessible from the ArcGIS Pro Project tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "* [Python Command Prompt](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/arcpy/get-started/installing-python-for-arcgis-pro.htm#ESRI_SECTION2_7FDA7FD13D724C51B442D8859F3A25A8)\n",
    " \n",

    "<p></p>\n",
    "* [Windows Command-Line](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc754340)\n",
    " \n",
    " The standard MS-DOS Windows command-line application.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** For additional technical information about conda and ArcGIS Pro, see these articles:\n",

    "  * [Conda and ArcGIS Pro 1.4](https://arcpy.wordpress.com/2016/10/21/conda-and-arcgis-pro/)\n",
    "***\n",
    "### Anaconda Distribution\n",
    "After the installation, Anaconda installs Python, conda, and hundreds of default packages into one environment:\n",
    "* root\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Manage conda environments with Anaconda:</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a couple different applications to manage your conda environments:\n",
    "* Terminal Application\n",
    "\n",
    " Standard command-line terminal applications on either the Windows, macOS, or Linux operating systems.\n",
    " \n",

    "## Activating Environments\n",
    "Use the activate command to switch between environments at a terminal application. See [Activating an environment](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment) for more information:\n",
    " * **Windows**:\n",
    " \n",
    "    `activate <environment_name>`\n",

    " * **macOS and Linux**: \n",
    " \n",
    "    `source activate <environment_name>`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding Packages to Environments\n",
    "The conda package management system can install thousands of packages accessed from various repositories called Channels. Channels may be a default set of cloud locations, such as Anaconda Cloud, or private repositories created by individuals or organizations. Conda searches a default set of channels when listing or installing packages. See [Managing Channels](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-channels.html) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Esri has created a conda repository at a channel named esri to store the arcgis package, which is how you installed the ArcGIS API for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add a package to the currently active environment at the terminal with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda install <package_name>`\n",
    "\n",
    "See [Managing Packages](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html) for detailed instructions on using the conda command-line interface. See the [The Default Environments](#The-Default-Environments) section for detailed instructions on using ArcGIS Pro or Anaconda tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up IDEs\n",
    "To begin projects in IDEs, you often have to specify the path to the Python interpreter. When using conda environments, each environment you uses a different Python interpreter. Type the following to get a list of all environments on your machine and the directory location of the specific Python interpreter (python.exe) used for that interpreter:\n",
    "\n",
    "`conda info --envs`\n",
    "\n",
    "![conda_info_envs Image Goes Here](http://esri.github.io/arcgis-python-api/notebooks/nbimages/conda_info_envs.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter the directory name and add python.exe to set the correct path to the Python interpreter for a specific environment.For example, the correct interpreter for the arcgispro-py3 environment in an IDE based on the screenshot above would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "`C:\\Program Files\\ArcGIS\\Pro\\bin\\Python\\envs\\arcgispro-py3\\python.exe`\n",
    "\n",
    "See [Finding your Anaconda Python interpreter path](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/integration/python-path) for more detailed instructions on different systems.\n",
    "\n",
